# Dashboard Map Current Status and Feature proposals.

Current Status:
  * The map has been added and can be moved and zoomed.
  * It is located in the map branch on this GitHub.
  * It requires a valid MapBox token in the Map.tsx file.
  
Future proposals:
  * Currently, the plan is to have the data shown on the map be determined by the selections made on the input form. However, it has been suggested that the map could be interactive in the sense that it can modify the seclections in the form based on the selctions on the map. For example, a selction on the map could show the statistics for the selected area.
